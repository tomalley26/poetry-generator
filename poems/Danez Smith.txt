O California, dont you know the sun is only a god
if you learn to starve for him? Iâ€™m bored with the ocean
I stood at the lip of it, dressed in down, praying for snow
I know, Im strange, too much light makes me nervous
at least in this land where the trees always bear green.
I know something that doesnt die cant be beautiful.
Have you ever stood on a frozen lake, California?
The sun above you, the snow and stalled sea a field of mirror
all demanding to be the sun too, everything around you
is light and its gorgeous and if you stay too long it will kill you
and its so sad, you know? Youre the only warm thing for miles
and the only thing that cant shine.
